# Certificate and it's Link Extractor

In this repository, I have created a python script that extracts the certificate and it's link from my linkedin profile and stores it in a csv file.

I've to first copy the ul element of the certificate and paste it on a text file named 'certificate.txt' and then run the script.

It will extract the certificate name and it's link and store it in a csv file named 'certificates.csv'.
